The project was executed by:

1- Jawaher Almheiri 

2- Maitha Alawadhi

3- Mariam Alhosani

4- Maysam Khalifa

The file consists of two main folders:

1- GUI - contains the gui to be run on local host

2- Models: contains the .py codes of the 4 used models

IMPORTANT:

- To setup the GUI environment (since github doesn't allow for large model files to be uploaded) please refer to the README.txt specified inside GUI/backend/model
